What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

Please explain these three skills in your own words.

Why do you need to not copy and paste?

Why is Practice and Persistence important?



< Problem Solving, Critical Thinking, Debugging>

< Problem solving is the process of using logic to figure something out.>

<Critical thinking is thinking outside the box, it is using your brain to analyze things using clues from what is in front of you and using your resources >

<Debugging is fixing a problem/issue/error with the code.>

<I dont need to copy and paste because typing the code into the terminal repeatedly gives practice with keying and muscle memory needed to be a successfull developer.>

<Practice and Persistece is important because without it you will not get familiar wit the command line, command line tools, or any language. Practicing over and over and continuing to push through the blank moments is what will make you a stronger developer over time.>
