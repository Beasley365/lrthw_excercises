Richard-Beasleys-MacBook-Pro:Chapter_1 $ ruby ex1.rb
ex1.rb:7: unterminated string meets end of file

 To get rid of this error i fixed the string by adding a single end quotation. I then ran the file again and I got the correct output

Hello World!
Hello Again
I like typing this.
This is fun.
Yay! Printing.
I'd much rather you 'not'.
I "said" do not touch this.
